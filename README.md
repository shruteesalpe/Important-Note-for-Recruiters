# Anyways....Hi, I'm Shrutee Salpe! 👋

I’m a Computer Engineering student who enjoys building real, practical systems — from full-stack applications to data-driven dashboards to AI/ML models. I love understanding how things work end-to-end, solving challenging problems, and continuously learning new technologies that help me grow as an engineer.

My work spans across:
- 🌐 **Software & Web Development** – full-stack applications and intuitive interfaces  
- 📊 **Data & Analytics** – working with datasets, visualizations, and insight-driven tools  
- 🤖 **AI, ML & Deep Learning** – including NLP, computer vision, and predictive modelling  
- 🧠 **Problem Solving & Optimization** – algorithms, logical reasoning, and system design  

I’m always excited to work on impactful systems, explore new engineering practices, and collaborate on innovative ideas.
